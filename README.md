# InteropBitmaps

This library is not "Yet Another imaging library", but a collection of very low level base types that can be used in conjuntion with other imaging libraries to help bridge them together.


Most imaging libraries allow for some degree of low level memory access, either through an InpPtr address, or a Span<T> or a plan Byte[] array.
